Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg have repeated this phrase countless times since the votes were counted last week, and both continue to pledge that their agreement -- the first, formal coalition government Britain has seen for 65 years -- will indeed deliver strength and stability.  That's partly because of a perceived sense that the British public -- and perhaps, of more immediate importance, the financial markets -- won't be enthused by weakness and instability.  But a \"strong and stable government\" is in the eye of the beholder - it isn't a fixed, defined notion.   How long will it be before the opposition Labour Party argues the Prime Minister and his Deputy have failed to live up to their pledge?",
