    There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
    Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and
    left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery,
    where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few
    hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers
    there.

    Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook
    to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you
    see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon
    thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the
    spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of
    ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a
    still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up
    in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.
    How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?

    But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
    seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
    extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
    warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
    they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
    them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and
    avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does
    the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships
    attract them thither?

    Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
    almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
    and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the
    most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man
    on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water,
    if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the
    great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be
    supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation
    and water are wedded for ever.

    But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
    quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the
    Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with
    a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps
    his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a
    sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to
    overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though
    the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its
    sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the
    shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the
    Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep
    among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop
    of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your
    thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly
    receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat,
    which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
    Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in
    him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as
    a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first
    told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old
    Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and
    own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still
    deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not
    grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
    was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.
    It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to
    it all.
