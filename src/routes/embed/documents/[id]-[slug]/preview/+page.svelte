  <h2>I</h2>
  <p>
    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
    I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that
    all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
  </p>
  <p>
    He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a
    reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In
    consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened
    up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few
    veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to
    this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that
    in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
    to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were
    unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity
    when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was
    quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at
    least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
    marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite
    hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as
    my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the
    fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that
    it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,
    but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came
    back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
    uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous
    excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the
    man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who
    represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality
    is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something
    gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as
    if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register
    earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do
    with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
    “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic
    readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not
    likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end;
    it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his
    dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and
    short-winded elations of men.

    My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city
    for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a
    tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual
    founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one,
    sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware
    business that my father carries on today.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special
    reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office.
    I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my
    father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration
    known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came
    back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle
    West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East
    and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I
    supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles
    talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally
    said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
    me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought,
    in the spring of twenty-two.
  </p>
  <p>
    The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season,
    and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a
    young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a
    commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a
    weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute
    the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I
    had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old
    Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered
    Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
