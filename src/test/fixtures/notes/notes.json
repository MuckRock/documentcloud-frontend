      "content": "Welcome to the new mantra in British politics.  Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg have repeated this phrase countless times since the votes were counted last week, and both continue to pledge that their agreement -- the first, formal coalition government Britain has seen for 65 years -- will indeed deliver strength and stability.  That's partly because of a perceived sense that the British public -- and perhaps, of more immediate importance, the financial markets -- won't be enthused by weakness and instability.  But a \"strong and stable government\" is in the eye of the beholder - it isn't a fixed, defined notion.   How long will it be before the opposition Labour Party argues the Prime Minister and his Deputy have failed to live up to their pledge?",
